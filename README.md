SMART PARKING SYSTEM




Project Requirements:

    Features:
1.Finding a parking place is not easier in shopping malls and public places.
2.A smart parking system allows the public to find information about the parking slot.
3.By Integrating Ultrasonic Sensors with the Parking Slots we can help the user in finding the empty slots.     
4.At the entrance, we can keep two LEDs for every slot and if the parking slot is filled it will  indicate with Red Led and if it is empty it will indicate with green Led.
5.whenever the user want to visit any malls or other places he will see the info regarding  parking Slots at the entrance itself.
